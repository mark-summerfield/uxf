## Config.py

This examples shows UXF being used both as an external storage format _and_
as the application's internal data store.

## tlm\_uxf.py

This example shows UXF being used as an exchange format. The program might
normally use a different form of external storage (e.g., a database), but
supports importing and exporting in UXF. This is useful because once
exported, the UXF data can be processed by generice UXF-handling tools, and
then reimported.
