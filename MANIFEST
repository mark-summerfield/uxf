# TODO
# - Nested tables? Try & if successful update docs.
#
# - make sure all test files have some nulls (for every typed value),
#   esp. t4, t24, t34
#
# - test --check and --fix-types:
#   . Add test t40.uxf that exercises all fixtypes in each of a
#     list, map, and table
#     (i.e., any→str, int↔float, str→bool|int|float|date|datetime)
#   . Add test t41.uxf ... one for every fixtype that cannot work
#   . Do 3 lots of tests: for t40.uxf ...:
#	* no check, no fixtypes
#	* check, no fixtypes
#	* check, fixtypes
# 
#   --strip-comments
#   Offer this?
#
# - create tests t50.uxf ... one for every error or warning that uxf.py
#   can produce to ensure they all work & are understandable.
#
# - test uxf to sqlite: t2.uxf t4.uxf t15.uxf t22.uxf t24.uxf t35.uxf
#
# - sqlite_to_uxf
#
# - test sqlite to uxf: t2.sqlite t4.sqlite t15.sqlite (should round trip)
#
# - uxf_to_xml: same tests as JSON for full round trip
#
# - xml_to_uxf: same tests as JSON for full round trip

# TODO (6) UXF libraries
# for .js use Dart or TypeScript or similar that can output JS
# uxf.rs uxf.cpp uxf.java uxf.rb ...

# IDEAS
# - experiment with using uxf format to store various kinds of data,
#   e.g., styled text, spreadsheet, graphics, etc.
