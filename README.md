# UXF Overview

Uniform eXchange Format (UXF) is a plain text human readable optionally
typed storage format. UXF may serve as a convenient alternative to csv, ini,
json, sqlite, toml, xml, or yaml.

UXF is an open standard. The UXF software linked from this page is all free
open source software.

The primary purpose of UXF is to make developers lives easier. It does this
by providing a convenient, scalable, easy-to-use file format that can be
used for most purposes, from configuration files to application data. And
UXF-based formats are very easy to adapt to future requirements

## Datatypes

UXF supports the following eleven built-indatatypes.


|**Type**<a name="table-of-built-in-types"></a>|**Example(s)**|**Notes**|
|-----------|----------------------|--|
|`null`     |`?`|`?` is the UXF _null_ type's literal representation.|
|`bool`     |`no` `yes`|Use `no` for false and `yes` for true.|
|`bytes`    |`(:20AC 65 66 48:)`|There must be an even number of case-insensitive hex digits; whitespace optional.|
|`date`     |`2022-04-01`|Basic ISO8601 YYYY-MM-DD format.|
|`datetime` |`2022-04-01T16:11:51`|ISO8601 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format (timezone support is library dependent).|
|`int`      |`-192` `+234` `7891409`||
|`real`     |`0.15` `0.7e-9` `2245.389`|Standard and scientific with at least one digit before and after the point.|
|`str`      |`<Some text which may include newlines>`|For &, <, >, use \&amp;, \&lt;, \&gt; respectively.|
|`list`     |`[value1 value2 ... valueN]`|A list of values of any type.|
|`list`     |`[vtype value1 value2 ... valueN]`|A list of values of type _vtype_.|
|`map`      |`{key1 value1 key2 value2 ... keyN valueN}`|A map with keys of any valid key type and values of any type.|
|`map`      |`{ktype key1 value1 key2 value2 ... keyN valueN}`|A map with keys of type _ktype_ and values of any type.|
|`map`      |`{ktype vtype key1 value1 key2 value2 ... keyN valueN}`|A map with keys of type _ktype_ and values of type _vtype_.|
|`table`    |`(ttype <value0_0> ... <value0_N> ... <valueM_0> ... <valueM_N>)`|A table of values. Each value's type must be of the corresponding type specified in the _ttype_, or any value type where no type has been specified.|

Note that it is also possible to represent [custom data
types](#custom-types).

### Terminology

- A `map` _key-value_ is collectively called an _item_.
- A “single” valued type (`bool`, `bytes`, `date`, `datetime`, `int`,
  `str`), is called a _scalar_.
- A “multi-” valued type (`list`, `map`, `table`) is called a _collection_.
- A `list`, `map`, or `table` which contains only scalar values is called a
  scalar `list`, scalar `map`, or scalar `table`, respectively.
- A `ttype` is the name of a table's user-defined type.

### Minimal empty UXF

    uxf 1.0
    []

Every UXF file consists of a header line (starting `uxf 1.0`). This may be
followed by an optional file-level comment, then any _ttype_ (table type)
imports, then any _ttype_ definitions. After this comes the data in the form
of a single `list`, `map`, or `table` in which all the values are stored.
The data must be present even if it is merely an empty list (as here), an
empty map (e.g., `{}`), or an empty table. Since ``list``s, ``map``s, and
``table``s can be nested inside each other, the UXF format is extremely
flexible.

### Built-in Types

Map keys (i.e., _ktype_) may only be of types `bytes`, `date`, `datetime`,
`int`, and `str`.

List, map, and table values may be of _any_ type (including nested ``map``s,
``list``s, and ``table``s), unless restricted to a specific type. If
restricted to a specific _vtype_, the _vtype_ may be any built-in type (as
listed above, except `null`), or any user-defined _ttype_, and the
corresponding value or values must be any valid value for the specified
type, or `?` (null).

Maps are insertion-ordered, that is, they preserve their items' order.

A `table` starts with a _ttype_. Next comes the table's values. The number
of values in any given row is equal to the number of field names in the
_ttype_.

Lists, maps, tables, and _ttype_ definitions may begin with a comment. And
lists, maps, and tables may optionally by typed as indicated above. (See
also the examples below and the BNF at the end).

Strings may not include `&`, `<` or `>`, so if they are needed, they must be
replaced by the XML/HTML escapes `&amp;`, `&lt;`, and `&gt;` respectively.

Where whitespace is allowed (or required) it may consist of one or more
spaces, tabs, or newlines in any combination.

If you don't want to be committed to a particular UXF type, just use a `str`
and do whatever conversion you want, or use a [custom type](#custom-types).

### Custom Types

There are two common approaches to handling custom types in UXF. Both
allow for UXFs to remain round-trip readable and writeable even by UXF
processors that aren't aware of the use of custom types as such.

Here, we'll look at both approaches for two different custom types, a
point and an enumeration.

    uxf 1.0
    [
      {<Point> [1.4 9.8]} {<Point> [-0.7 3.0]} {<Point> [2.1 -6.3]}
      <TrafficLightGreen> <TrafficLightAmber> <TrafficLightRed>
    ]

This first approach shows three points, each represented by a `map` with a
`str` indicating the type and using ``list``s of two ``real``s for the real
and imaginary parts of the number. The example also shows a traffic light
enumeration each represented by a `str`.

    uxf 1.0
    [
      {<Point> [1.4 9.8 -0.7 3.0 2.1 -6.3]}
      <TrafficLightGreen> <TrafficLightAmber> <TrafficLightRed>
    ]

Since we have multiple points we've changed to a `map` with a `list` of
point values. This is more compact but assumes that the reading application
knows that points come in pairs.

A UXF processor has no knowledge of these representations of points or
enumerations, but will handle both seamlessly since they are both
represented in terms of built-in UXF types. Nonetheless, an application that
reads such UXF data can recognize and convert to and from these
representations to and from the actual types.

    uxf 1.0
    =Point x:real y:real
    =TrafficLightGreen
    =TrafficLightAmber
    =TrafficLightRed
    [
      (Point 1.4 9.8 -0.7 3.0 2.1 -6.3)
      (TrafficLightRed) (TrafficLightGreen) (TrafficLightAmber)
    ]

This second approach uses four _ttypes_. For the Point we specify it as
having two real fields (so the processor now knows that Point values come in
twos). And for the enumeration we used three separate fieldness tables.

Using tables gives us the advantage that we can represent any number of
values of a particular _ttype_ in a single table (including just one, or
even none), thus cutting down on repetitive text. And some UXF processor
libraries will be able to return table values as custom types. (For example,
the [Python UXF library](py/README.md) would return these as custom class
instances—as “editable tuples”.)

If many applications need to use the same _ttypes_, it _may_ make sense to
create some shared _ttype_ definitions. See [Imports](#imports) for how to
do this.

## Examples

### Minimal UXFs

    uxf 1.0
    {}

We saw earlier an example of a minimal UXF file with an empty list; here we
have one with an empty map.

    uxf 1.0
    =Pair first second
    (Pair)

Here is a UXF with a _ttype_ specifying a Pair that has two fields each of
which can hold _any_ UXF value (including nested collections). In this case
the data is a single _empty_ Pair table.

    uxf 1.0
    =Pair first second
    (Pair (Pair 1 2) (Pair 3 (Pair 4 5)))

And here is a UXF with a single Pair table that contains two nested Pair
tables, the second of which itself contains a nested pair.

### CSV to UXF

#### CSV

    Date,Price,Quantity,ID,Description
    "2022-09-21",3.99,2,"CH1-A2","Chisels (pair), 1in & 1¼in"
    "2022-10-02",4.49,1,"HV2-K9","Hammer, 2lb"
    "2022-10-02",5.89,1,"SX4-D1","Eversure Sealant, 13-floz"

#### UXF equivalents

The most obvious translation would be to a `list` of ``list``s:

    uxf 1.0
    [
      [<Price List> <Date> <Price> <Quantity> <ID> <Description>]
      [2022-09-21 3.99 2 <CH1-A2> <Chisels (pair), 1in &amp; 1¼in>]
      [2022-10-02 4.49 1 <HV2-K9> <Hammer, 2lb>]
      [2022-10-02 5.89 1 <SX4-D1> <Eversure Sealant, 13-floz>]
    ]

This is perfectly valid. However, it has the same problem as `.csv` files:
is the first row data values or column titles? (For software this isn't
always obvious, for example, if all the values are strings.) Not to mention
the fact that we have to use a nested `list` of ``list``s. Nonetheless it is
an improvement, since unlike the `.csv` representation, every value has a
concrete type (all ``str``s for the first row, and `date`, `real`, `int`,
`str`, `str`, for the rest).

The most _appropriate_ UXF equivalent is to use a UXF `table`:

    uxf 1.0
    =PriceList Date Price Quantity ID Description
    (PriceList
      2022-09-21 3.99 2 <CH1-A2> <Chisels (pair), 1in &amp; 1¼in> 
      2022-10-02 4.49 1 <HV2-K9> <Hammer, 2lb> 
      2022-10-02 5.89 1 <SX4-D1> <Eversure Sealant, 13-floz> 
    )

When one or more tables are used each one's _ttype_ (table type) must be
defined at the start of the `.uxf` file. A ttype definition begins with an
`=` sign followed by the ttype (i.e., the table name), followed by one or
more fields. A field consists of a name optionally followed by a `:` and
then a type (here only names are given).

Both table and field names are user chosen and consist of 1-60 letters,
digits, or underscores, starting with a letter or underscore. No table or
field name may be the same as any built-in type name, so no table or field
can be called `bool`, `bytes`, `date`, `datetime`, `int`, `list`, `map`,
`null`, `real`, `str`, or `table`. (But `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Real` or
`real_` are fine, since names are case-sensitive and none of the built-in
types contains an underscore.) If whitespace is wanted one convention is to
use underscores in their place.

Once we have defined a _ttype_ we can use it.

Here, we've created a single table whose _ttype_ is "PriceList". There's no
need to group rows into lines as we've done here (although doing so is
common and easier for human readability), since the UXF processor knows how
many values go into each row based on the number of field names. In this
example, the UXF processor will treat every five values as a single record
(row) since the _ttype_ has five fields.

    uxf 1.0 Price List
    =PriceList Date:date Price:real Quantity:int ID:str Description:str
    (PriceList
      2022-09-21 3.99 2 <CH1-A2> <Chisels (pair), 1in &amp; 1¼in> 
      2022-10-02 4.49 1 <HV2-K9> <Hammer, 2lb> 
      2022-10-02 5.89 1 <SX4-D1> <Eversure Sealant, 13-floz> 
    )

Here we've added a custom file description in the header, and we've also
added field types to the _ttype_ definition. When types are specified, the
UXF processor is expected to be able to check that each value is of the
correct type. Omit the type altogether (as in the earliler examples) to
indicate _any_ valid table type.

    uxf 1.0 Price List
    =PriceList Date:date Price:real Quantity:int ID:str Description:str
    (PriceList)

Just for completeness, here's an example of an empty table.

### INI to UXF

#### INI

    shapename = Hexagon
    zoom = 150
    showtoolbar = False
    [Window1]
    x=615
    y=252
    width=592
    height=636
    scale=1.1
    [Window2]
    x=28
    y=42
    width=140
    height=81
    scale=1.0
    [Window3]
    x=57
    y=98
    width=89
    height=22
    scale=0.5
    [Files]
    current=test1.uxf
    recent1=/tmp/test2.uxf
    recent2=C:\Users\mark\test3.uxf

#### UXF equivalents

This first equivalent is a simplistic conversion that we'll improve in
stages.

    uxf 1.0 MyApp 1.2.0 Config
    =Files Kind Filename
    {
      <General> {
        <shapename> <Hexagon>
        <zoom> 150
        <showtoolbar> no
      }
      <Window1> {
        <x> 615
        <y> 252
        <width> 592
        <height> 636
        <scale> 1.1
      }
      <Window2> {
        <x> 28
        <y> 42
        <width> 140
        <height> 81
        <scale> 1.0
      }
      <Window3> {
        <x> 57
        <y> 98
        <width> 89
        <height> 22
        <scale> 0.5
      }
      <Files> (Files
        <current> <test1.uxf> 
        <recent1> </tmp/test2.uxf> 
        <recent2> <C:\Users\mark\test3.uxf> 
      )
    }

UXF accepts `no` for `bool` `false` and `yes` for `bool` `true`. (`0` and
`1` cannot be used as ``bool``s since the UXF processor would interpret them
as ``int``s.)

For configuration data it is often convenient to use ``map``s with name
keys and data values. In this case the overall data is a `map` which
contains each configuration section. The values of each of the first two of
the ``map``'s keys are themselves ``map``s. But for the third key's value
we use a `table`. The table's _ttype_ is defined at the start and consists
of two untyped fields.

Of course, we can nest as deep as we like and mix ``list``s and ``map``s.
For example, here's an alternative:

    uxf 1.0 MyApp 1.2.0 Config
    =pos x:int y:int
    =size width:int height:int
    {
      <General> {#<Miscellaneous settings>
        <shapename> <Hexagon> <zoom> 150 <showtoolbar> no <Files> {
          <current> <test1.uxf>
          <recent> [#<From most to least recent>
          </tmp/test2.uxf> <C:\Users\mark\test3.uxf>]
        }
      }
      <Window1> {#<Window dimensions and scales> str
        <pos> (pos 615 252)
        <size> (size 592 636)
        <scale> 1.1
      }
      <Window2> {
        <pos> (pos 28 42)
        <size> (size 140 81)
        <scale> 1.0
      }
      <Window3> {
        <pos> (pos 57 98)
        <size> (size 89 22)
        <scale> 0.5
      }
    }

Here, we've laid out the _General_ and _Window_ maps more compactly. We've
also moved the _Files_ into _General_ and changed the _Files_ from a `table`
to a two-item `map` with the second item's value being a `list` of
filenames. We've also changed the _x_, _y_ coordinates and the _width_ and
_height_ into "pos" and "size" tables. Notice that for each of these tables
we've defined their _ttype_ to include both field names and types.

We've also added some example comments to two of the ``map``s. A comment is
a `#` immediately followed by a `str`. A comment may only be placed at the
start of a list before the optional _vtype_ or the first value, or at the
start of a map before the optional _ktype_ or the first key, or at the start
of a table before the _ttype_ name.

    uxf 1.0 MyApp 1.2.0 Config
    =pos x:int y:int
    =size width:int height:int
    {#<We want str keys and map values> str map
      <General> {#<We want str keys and any values> str
        <shapename> <Hexagon> <zoom> 150 <showtoolbar> no <Files> { str
          <current> <test1.uxf>
          <recent> [ #<From most to least recent> str
          </tmp/test2.uxf> <C:\Users\mark\test3.uxf>]
        }
      }
      <Windows> {#<Window dimensions and scales>
        <pos> (pos 615 252 28 42 57 98)
        <size> (size 592 636 140 81 89 22)
        <scale> [1.1 1.0 0.5]
      }
    }

Here we've added some types. The outermost map must have `str` keys and
`map` values, and the _General_, _Files_, and _Window_ maps must all have
`str` keys and _any_ values. For ``map``s we may specify the key and
value types, or just the key type, or neither. We've also specified that the
_recent_ files ``list``'s values must be ``str``s.

Notice that instead of individual "Windows" entries we've just used one.
Since "pos" and "size" are tables they can have as many rows as we like, in
this case three (since each row has two fields based on each table's
_ttype_).

    uxf 1.0 MyApp 1.2.0 Config
    =#<Window dimensions> Geometry x:int y:int width:int height:int scale:real
    {#<Notes on this configuration file format> str map
      <General> {#<Miscellaneous settings> str
        <shapename> <Hexagon> <zoom> 150 <showtoolbar> no <Files> {str
          <current> <test1.uxf>
          <recent> [#<From most to least recent> str
          </tmp/test2.uxf> <C:\Users\mark\test3.uxf>]
        }
      }
      <Windows> (#<Window dimensions and scales> Geometry
         615 252 592 636 1.1
         28 42 140 81 1.0
         57 98 89 22 0.5
      )
    }

For this final variation we've gathered all the window data into a single
table type and laid it out for human readability. We could, of course, have
just written it as `(Geometry 615 252 592 636 1.1 28 42 140 81 1.0 57 98 89
22 0.5)`.

### Database to UXF

A database normally consists of one or more tables. A UXF equivalent using
a `list` of ``table``s is easily made.

    uxf 1.0 MyApp Data
    =Customers CID Company Address Contact Email
    =Invoices INUM CID Raised_Date Due_Date Paid Description
    =Items IID INUM Delivery_Date Unit_Price Quantity Description
    [#<There is a 1:M relationship between the Invoices and Items tables>
      (Customers
        50 <Best People> <123 Somewhere> <John Doe> <j@doe.com> 
        19 <Supersuppliers> ? <Jane Doe> <jane@super.com> 
      )
      (Invoices
        152 50 2022-01-17 2022-02-17 no <COD> 
        153 19 2022-01-19 2022-02-19 yes <> 
      )
      (Items
        1839 152 2022-01-16 29.99 2 <Bales of hay> 
        1840 152 2022-01-16 5.98 3 <Straps> 
        1620 153 2022-01-19 11.5 1 <Washers (1-in)> 
      )
    ]

Here we have a `list` of ``table``s representing three database tables.
The `list` begins with a comment.

Notice that the second customer has a null (`?`) address and the second
invoice has an empty description.

    uxf 1.0 MyApp Data
    #<It is also possible to have one overall comment at the beginning,
    after the uxf header and before any ttype definitions or the data.>
    =Customers CID:int Company:str Address:str Contact:str Email:str
    =Invoices INUM:int CID:int Raised_Date:date Due_Date:date Paid:bool Description:str
    =Items IID:int INUM:int Delivery_Date:date Unit_Price:real Quantity:int Description:str
    [#<There is a 1:M relationship between the Invoices and Items tables>
      (Customers
        50 <Best People> <123 Somewhere> <John Doe> <j@doe.com> 
        19 <Supersuppliers> ? <Jane Doe> <jane@super.com> 
      )
      (Invoices
        152 50 2022-01-17 2022-02-17 no <COD> 
        153 19 2022-01-19 2022-02-19 yes <> 
      )
      (Items
        1839 152 2022-01-16 29.99 2 <Bales of hay> 
        1840 152 2022-01-16 5.98 3 <Straps> 
        1620 153 2022-01-19 11.5 1 <Washers (1-in)> 
      )
    ]

Here, we've added types to each table's _ttype_.

It is conventional in a database to have IDs and foreign keys. But these can
often be avoided by using hierarchical data. For example:

    uxf 1.0 MyApp Data
    =Customers CID:int Company:str Address:str Contact:str Email:str
    =Invoices INUM:int CID:int Raised_Date:date Due_Date:date Paid:bool
    Description:str Items:Items
    =Items IID:int Delivery_Date:date Unit_Price:real Quantity:int Description:str
    [#<There is a 1:M relationship between the Invoices and Items tables>
        (Customers
        50 <Best People> <123 Somewhere> <John Doe> <j@doe.com> 
        19 <Supersuppliers> ? <Jane Doe> <jane@super.com> 
        )
        (Invoices
        152 50 2022-01-17 2022-02-17 no <COD> (Items
            1839 2022-01-16 29.99 2 <Bales of hay> 
            1840 2022-01-16 5.98 3 <Straps>

Notice that Items no longer need an INUM to identify the Invoice they belong
to because they are nested inside their Invoice. However, the relational
approach has been retained for Customers since more than one Invoice could
be for the same Customer.

What if we wanted to add some extra configuration data to the database? One
solution would be to make the first item in the `list` a `map`, with the
remainder ``table``s, as now. Another solution would be to use a `map` for
the container, something like:

    {
        <config> { #<Key-value configuration data goes here> }
        <tables> [ #<The list of tables as above follows here>
            
        ]
    }

### Mixed Example

    uxf 1.0
    =Pair First Second
    =Triple First Second Third
    =Parts column
    [#<Nested tables>
      (Pair (Pair 17 21) (Pair 98 65))
      (Triple
        (Pair <a> <b>) (Triple 2020-01-17 2020-02-18 2021-12-05) (Pair ? no)
        1 2 3
        <x> <y> (Pair)
      )
    ]

This rather abstract example gives a flavor of what's possible.
Here we have a list of tables, with some tables nested inside others. For
the last triple we have two ``str``s ("x” and "y”), and an _empty_ Pair.

## Libraries

_Implementations in additional languages are planned._

|**Library**|**Language**|**Notes**                    |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|
|uxf        | Python 3   | See the [Python UXF library](py/README.md).|

## Imports

UXF files are normally completely self-contained. However, in some cases it
may be desirable to share a set of _ttype_ definitions amongst a bunch of
UXF files.

The _disadvantages_ of doing this are first that the relevant UXF files become
dependent on one or more external dependencies and second it is possible to
have import conflicts (i.e., two _ttypes_ with the same name but different
definitions. (However, the first disadvantage doesn't apply if all the
dependencies are provided by the UXF processor itself, i.e., are system
imports.)

The _advantage_ of importing _ttype_ definitions is that for UXF's that have
lots of _ttypes_, only the import(s) and the data need be in the file,
without having to repeat all the _ttype_ definitions.

Imports go at the start of the file _after_ the header and _after_ any
file-level comment, and _before_ any _ttype_ definitions. Each import must
be on its own line and may not span lines.

If a filename import has no path or a relative path, the import attempt will
be made relative to the importing `.uxf` file, and failing that relative to
each path in  the `UXF_PATH` environment variable (if it exists and is
nonempty), and failing all that relative to the current folder.

Any _ttype_ definition that follows an import will redefine any imported
defintion of the same name.

|**Import**|**Notes**|
|----------|---------|
|`! ttype-test`|These imports are provided by the UXF processor itself|
|`! mydefs.uxf`|Import the _ttypes_ from `mydefs.uxf` in the current folder (or from a folder in the `UXF_PATH`)|
|`! /path/to/shared.uxf`|Import the _ttypes_ from the given file|
|`! http://www.qtrac.eu/ttype-eg.uxf`|Import from the given URL|

The imported file must be a valid UXF file. It need not have a `.uxf` suffix
(e.g., you might prefer `.uxt`), but must have a `.gz` suffix if gzip
compressed. Any custom string, comments, or data the imported file may
contain are ignored: only the _ttype_ definitions are used.

    uxf 1.0
    !complex
    !fraction
    [(Complex 5.1 7.2 8e-2 -9.1e6 0.1 -11.2) <a string> (Fraction 22 7 355 113)]

Here we've used the official system ``complex``'s `Complex` and
``fraction``'s `Fraction` _ttypes_ without having to specify them
explicitly. The data represented is a list consisting of three Complex
numbers each holding two ``real``s each, a `str`, and two Fractions holding
two ``int``s each.

We recommend avoiding imports and using stand-alone `.uxf` files. Some UXF
processors can do UXF to UXF conversions that will replace imports with
(actually used) _ttype_ definitions.

## BNF

A `.uxf` file consists of a mandatory header followed by an optional
file-level comment, optional imports, optional _ttype_ definitions, and then
a single mandatory `list`, `map`, or `table` (which may be empty).

    UXF          ::= 'uxf' RWS REAL CUSTOM? '\n' CONTENT
    CUSTOM       ::= RWS [^\n]+ # user-defined data e.g. filetype and version
    CONTENT      ::= COMMENT? IMPORT* TTYPEDEF* (MAP | LIST | TABLE)
    IMPORT       ::= '!' /\s*/ IMPORT_FILE '\n' # See below for IMPORT_FILE
    TTYPEDEF     ::= '=' COMMENT? OWS IDENFIFIER (RWS FIELD)* # IDENFIFIER is the ttype (i.e., the table name)
    FIELD        ::= IDENFIFIER (OWS ':' OWS VALUETYPE)? # IDENFIFIER is the field name
    MAP          ::= '{' COMMENT? MAPTYPES? OWS (KEY RWS VALUE)? (RWS KEY RWS VALUE)* OWS '}'
    MAPTYPES     ::= OWS KEYTYPE (RWS VALUETYPE)?
    KEYTYPE      ::= 'int' | 'date' | 'datetime' | 'str' | 'bytes'
    VALUETYPE    ::= KEYTYPE | 'bool' | 'real' | 'list' | 'map' | 'table' | IDENFIFIER # IDENFIFIER is table name
    LIST         ::= '[' COMMENT? LISTTYPE? OWS VALUE? (RWS VALUE)* OWS ']'
    LISTTYPE     ::= OWS VALUETYPE
    TABLE        ::= '(' COMMENT? OWS IDENFIFIER (RWS VALUE)* ')' # IDENFIFIER is the ttype (i.e., the table name)
    COMMENT      ::= OWS '#' STR
    KEY          ::= INT | DATE | DATETIME | STR | BYTES
    VALUE        ::= KEY | NULL | BOOL | REAL | LIST | MAP | TABLE
    NULL         ::= '?'
    BOOL         ::= 'no' | 'yes'
    INT          ::= /[-+]?\d+/
    REAL         ::= # standard or scientific notation
    DATE         ::= /\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d/ # basic ISO8601 YYYY-MM-DD format
    DATETIME     ::= /\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d(:\d\d)?(Z|[-+]\d\d(:?[:]?\d\d)?)?/ # see note below
    STR          ::= /[<][^<>]*?[>]/ # newlines allowed, and &amp; &lt; &gt; supported i.e., XML
    BYTES        ::= '(:' (OWS [A-Fa-f0-9]{2})* OWS ':)'
    IDENFIFIER   ::= /[_\p{L}]\w{0,59}/ # Must start with a letter or underscore; may not be a built-in typename or constant
    OWS          ::= /[\s\n]*/
    RWS          ::= /[\s\n]+/ # in some cases RWS is actually optional

Note that a UXF file _must_ contain a single list, map, or table, even if
it is empty.

An `IMPORT_FILE` may be a filename which does _not_ contain a `.` (i.e.,
doesn't have a file suffix), in which case it is a “system” UXF file
provided by the UXF processor itself. (Currently there is just one system
file, `ttype-test`, purely for testing.) Or it may be a filename with a
relative or absolute path (or no path and taken to be in the same folder as
the `.uxf` file that refers to it) or in a folder in the `UXF_PATH`. Or it
may be a URL referring to an external UXF file. For non-system files a
suffixe is required, but any suffix is acceptable (e.g., `.uxf`, `.uxt`,
`.mysuffix`).

To indicate any type valid for the context, simply omit the type name.

As the BNF shows, `list`, `map`, and `table` values may be of _any_ type
including nested ``list``s, ``map``s, and ``table``s.

For a `table`, after the optional comment, there must be an identifier which
is the table's _ttype_. This is followed by the table's values. There's no
need to distinguish between one row and the next (although it is common to
start new rows on new lines) since the number of fields indicate how many
values each row has. It is possible to create tables that have no fields;
these might be used for representing enumerations.

If a list value, map key, or table value's type is specified, then the UXF
processor is expected to be able to check for (and if requested and
possible, correct) any mistyped values. UXF readers and writers are expected
to preserve map items in the original reading order (first to last) (i.e.,
in insertion order).

For ``datetime``s, support may vary across different UXF libraries and
might _not_ include timezone support. For example, the Python library
only supports timezones as time offsets; for `Z` etc, the `dateutil`
module must be installed, but even that doesn't necessarily support the full
ISO8601 specification.

Note that a UXF reader (writer) _must_ be able to read (write) a plain text
`.uxf` file containing UTF-8 encoded text, and _ought_ to be able to read
and write gzipped plain text `.uxf.gz` files.

Note also that UXF readers and writers should not care about the actual file
extension (apart from the `.gz` needed for gzipped files), since users are
free to use their own. For example, `data.myapp` and `data.myapp.gz`.

## Vim Support

If you use the vim editor, simple color syntax highlighting is available.
Copy `uxf.vim` into your `$VIM/syntax/` folder and add these lines (or
similar) to your `.vimrc` or `.gvimrc` file:

    au BufRead,BufNewFile,BufEnter * if getline(1) =~ '^uxf ' | setlocal ft=uxf | endif
    au BufRead,BufNewFile,BufEnter *.uxf set ft=uxf|set expandtab|set tabstop=2|set softtabstop=2|set shiftwidth=2
