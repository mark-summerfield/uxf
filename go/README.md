# Go UXF Library

Uniform eXchange Format (UXF) is a plain text human readable optionally
typed storage format that supports custom types.

UXF is designed to make life easier for software developers and data
designers. It directly competes with csv, ini, json, toml, and yaml formats.
A key advantage of UXF is its support for custom (i.e., user-defined) types.
This can result in more compact, more readable, and easier to parse data.
And in some contexts it may prove to be a convenient alternative to sqlite
or xml.

For details of the Uniform eXchange Format (UXF) supported by this library,
see the [UXF Overview](../README.md). ([Go UXF
Overview](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mark-summerfield/uxf).)

**Hopefully someone else will implement Go Marshal() and Unmarshall() for
UXF format…** _This could be an ideal—although challenging—computer science
undergraduate final year project._
