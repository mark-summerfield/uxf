uxf is a library that supports the UXF format. UXF is a plain text human
readable optionally typed storage format. UXF may serve as a convenient
alternative to csv, ini, json, sqlite, toml, xml, or yaml.

TODO

Comments, ktypes, vtypes, are all strings. If a ktype or vtype is empty this
means that any valid ktype or vtype respectively is acceptable.
For TClasses the ttype is also a string, and this may not be empty.
